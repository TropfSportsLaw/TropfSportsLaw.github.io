    <h1>About Our Company</h1>
    <p>More Than Just Representation!
    At Tropf's Sport INC, we believe that every athlete has a story-a journey fuled by passion, dedication, and the unwavering pursuit of greatness. Our story begins with a simple but powerful idea: to create a sports agency that sees atheltes not just as players, but as <strong>people</strong> with dreams, familes, futures, and limitless potential both on and off the field.
    Founded by former athletes, coaches, and industry professionals, Tropf's Sport INC was built on firsthand knowledge of the challenges athletes face. We've experienced the highs of victory and the lows of injury, the pressures of performance, and the uncertainty of life after the game. We understand that an athlete's career doesn't start or end with a single season-it's a lifelong journey that deserves thoughtful guidance and dedicated support.</p>
